              Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi was an extremely charismatic, dynamic and divine personality who radiated nothing but love. She had absolute unconditional love ‚Äì nirvajya prema (‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ú ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Æ) ‚Äì with which she saw the spiritual potential of people and the heart of divinity in all creation. It emanated from her like a relentless magnetic force. To see this magnetism in action in one of her many thousands of programs was to bear witness to the care, compassion, and command with which she attended to the woes and worries of those who sought her guidance until each question had found its answer, all sound was replaced with profound silence, and a glint of light shone bright in eyes that beheld that which was right. Truly an awe inspiring personality.

An electromagnetic vibration called "Param Chaitanya" which governs five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Sky) can bring positive transformation in Plants, Animals, Fish, Birds etc. The "Param Chaitanya" can transform agricultural products such as Seeds, Feeds, Water etc., which are then used for routine Agricultural Production.</p>
